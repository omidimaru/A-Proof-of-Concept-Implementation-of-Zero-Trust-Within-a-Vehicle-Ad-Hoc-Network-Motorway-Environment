# A-Proof-of-Concept-Implementation-of-Zero-Trust-Within-a-Vehicle-Ad-Hoc-Network-Motorway-Environment
Master's Thesis code implementation of Zero Trust in a VANET

This code has been developed by me, Ben Dawson, as part of my Master's Thesis of the same title, during the Master's in Cybersecurity course provided by
Munster Technological University.

You can use this code however you want, but if you do use it I'd appreciate if you attribute it to me.

This project was developed for the NS3 version 3.36.1 network simulation software.
